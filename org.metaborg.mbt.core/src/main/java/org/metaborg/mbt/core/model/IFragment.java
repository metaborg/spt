/**
 * A Fragment represents a piece of code within an SPT test suite, written in another language.
 * 
 * Examples are the fragment of a test case, or the fragment of a 'parse to' test expectation. The former would be
 * written in the language under test, the latter possibly in another language.
 * 
 * The problem with Fragments, is that the text has to be extracted from the original SPT specification, and parsed with
 * another language, while keeping the offsets of the nodes in the returned parse result correct within the larger
 * context of the SPT specification.
 * 
 * The IFragment simply represents the SPT AST node and the selected regions within that node. These selected regions
 * have offsets based on the SPT AST, which is why parsing a fragment should be done using an IFragmentParser, to ensure
 * that the character offsets of the parse result match properly with the selected regions.
