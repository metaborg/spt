# SPT Test Runner for IntelliJ
This plugin adds a test runner for SPT tests to IntelliJ IDEA. (It however does not add syntax highlighting. Use the [Spoofax for IntelliJ][1] plugin for that.)

## Installation
To install the SPT test runner in your IntelliJ installation:

1. In IntelliJ, go to _File_ â†’ _Settings_ menu.
2. Go to the _Plugins_ tab, and click the _Browse repositories..._ button.
3. Search for `SPT` and install the _SPT_ plugin by _Metaborg_.
4. Restart IntelliJ to load the plugin.

This plugin has no dependencies on other plugins, i.e. it can be used without the [Spoofax for IntelliJ][1] plugin, although you won't have syntax highlighting.



## Usage
To use the SPT test runner on your Spoofax project in IntelliJ:

1. Create a new _Spoofax SPT_ run configuration.
2. Set the _Test folder_ to the folder that contains the SPT test files.
3. Set the _Language module_ to the module that contains the language used in the tests.
4. Save the new configuration.
5. Run the new configuration.

## Overview
This plugin contains just the parts that are necessary to add a run configuration to IntelliJ. It has three main dependencies:

- [Metaborg Core][4] - The core library used by all Spoofax languages. This plugin mostly uses the test reporter functionality.
- [SPT Command Line][5] - The SPT command-line test runner, which is invoked by the run configuration.
- [SPT Language][6] - The SPT language, used by the command-line utility to parse the test suites.

The main resources useful for working on this plugin are:
